## 📋 About The Project 

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/G3kYbDqP/CLAP.png" alt="Logo" width="1024" height="500">

<p align="center">
🖥️ Steam_DL is a simple tool for downloading game files and DLCs directly from servers on the Steam platform. 🖥️
</p>

Why should I use it?:
* 🔧 Verifying your game files via Steam is not working, either due to maintenance or for some other reason. 🔧
* 🕹️ You want to try some of these games before buying them. 😇 (Please buy them) 😇
* 🤷 The game you want is no longer in your Steam library. 🤷

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## 📲 Usage

<h3 align="center">📩 To use Steam_DL, launch ‘Steam_DL.exe’ and :. </h3>

* 💾 If you choose to press 1, type in the name of your game to check if it is in our database. If it is, just type in the number next to the name of your game and press Enter to start the backup. Your Steam should restart. Then go to your Steam Library and you should find your game by typing its name.

* 💾 If you choose to press 2, you will need to enter your game ID number yourself. To do this, go to the Steam Store and go to your game's page, and retrieve the numbers found here, in place of the “x” `(https://store.steampowered.com/app/'xxxxxxx'/ARC_Raiders/)`. Once you have copied these numbers, simply paste them into the tool, your Steam will restart, and you will be able to find the game in your Steam Library.

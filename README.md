<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## 📋 About The Project 📋

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

<p align="center">
🖥️ Steam_DL is a simple tool for downloading game files and DLCs directly from servers on the Steam platform. 🖥️
</p>

Why should I use it?:
* 🔧 Verifying your game files via Steam is not working, either due to maintenance or for some other reason. 🔧
* 🕹️ You want to try some of these games before buying them. 😇 (Please buy them) 😇
* 🤷 The game you want is no longer in your Steam library. 🤷

<h3 align="center">‼️ Of course, we do not provide any kind of support for pirated games and DLCs. It is your responsibility if any of your content is not functional.‼️</h3>

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

## ⚠️ Important Note to users ⚠️

<h3 align="center">⚠️ Attention, this tool does not work if you have more than 1 active steam account on your computer ⚠️ </h3>
